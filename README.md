- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abby Otten (@aotten5)!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in materials science and engineering applications for renewable energy systems, specifically battery technology. I am particularly focused on the mechanics of alloying electrode materials.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about LixSb phase formation and microstrain investigated with in-situ XRD experiments.
